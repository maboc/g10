Yet another attempt to a network database
Commands that now actually work:
1. base display                 : displays a full base (potentially very expensive)
2. bases list                   : lists all bases in the system
3. config display               : displays the configuration
4. node search <key> <value>    : search a node based on a key and a value
5. use <swid>                   : uses <swid> as the active base (the base on which operations are executed)
