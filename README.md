## What?
g10 is my attempt to create a network database.
I do not have much theoretical knowledge about graph theory, so naming is different from what is found in textbooks

## Good to know
Nothing in this software is ready for anyone else then me to see it.
Why then have it on public available github? Well..I needed a place where I can park it outside home :-) Preferably on a system which is capable of tracking versions etc. ...GitHub is a usual suspect then I guess 

## Why?
- To improve my c-skills. I'm not very skilled at C so an width project seems a nice way to improve myself.
- Profesionally I'm a Oracle DBA. I really like to explore other fields of databases. Creating my own database seems like a nice opportunity.
- I like the nitty-gritty details of (technical) systems. No better way then to fall in all traps developers allready felled in so many times. (I'm an avid believer in reinventing the wheel over and over again, as a learning exercise.
  
## How?
- There are bases.
- These bases have nodes
- These nodes have attributes
- These nodes have also relations (to other nodes)
- The relations also have attributes

In a lot of writing you may find the term swid. This is a System Wide Identifier. Every item (base/node/relation/attribute) in the system has a unique swid
